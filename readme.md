This is a fragment of a project I have been working on and contributing to for the last 2 years.

A number of pages, components, hooks and utilities have been extracted for a showcase. A small subset of the whole project has been selected in order to keep references to external entities to a minimum and to give an insight into the quality of the code. Even with the totality of the code available it would not be possible to run it easily, as there is a significant set-up phase with multiple tools included, and because of that, the main purpose of this codebase is to inspect the style and practices applied when writing the code.

The files have the directive "@ts-ignore" / "@ts-nocheck" on the top in order to avoid excessive red error underlining of missing imports. On a day-to-day basis, ignoring TypeScript errors and warnings is very rarely practiced and disapproved of.

The components and pages included in this fragment were created by me in full or co-authored, and as such may be a product of a whole team of developers with various attitudes and methodologies, developed over a long time, thus certain aspects of the project still hold room for improvements and refactors. I would be very glad to talk about this code during an upcoming meeting.
